# remoteos-gateway (dev1 MCP gateway, #25) — gotchas

- **HTTP client is `httpx2`, not `httpx`.** `httpx2` is what fastmcp and mcp use at runtime,
  and it is pinned directly. Plain `httpx` exists only in the `test` extra.
  - `client.send(httpx2.Request(...), stream=True)` sends the request AS-IS. No client default
    headers are added (no `Accept-Encoding`, no cookies), which is what keeps the proxy
    transparent. Do not switch to `client.build_request()`.
  - Relay the body with `aiter_raw()`, never `aiter_bytes()`. The body must pass through raw,
    so `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Length` stay valid.
- **`httpx2.ASGITransport` buffers the whole response body.** A test through it cannot prove
  streaming. Drive the ASGI app directly with a custom `send` (see
  `test_sse_is_streamed_chunk_by_chunk_not_buffered`): the upstream yields part 2 only after
  the consumer has received part 1, so a buffering proxy deadlocks into the 5 s timeout.
- **uvicorn advertises ASGI spec_version 2.3.** So Starlette's `StreamingResponse` runs
  `listen_for_disconnect` and cancels the stream on disconnect.
  - Its `background=` task does NOT run when the stream raises. That is why
    `_UpstreamResponse.__call__` closes the upstream and writes the log line in a `finally`.
  - `test_upstream_is_closed_even_when_the_consumer_vanishes_before_headers` locks this in.
- **Decision order is 401 → 403 → 404**, the design order. An authenticated consumer must not
  be able to probe which other machines are exposed. The body is read only after the
  allow-list and exposure checks pass.
- **Never log or forward the consumer token, the machine key, or tool arguments.**
  - `Upstream.authorization` is `repr=False`.
  - The access log keeps only `rpc_method` and the `tools/call` `params.name`.
  - Tests assert all three never appear.
- **Fail closed.** A deleted registry is an empty registry (deny all). A broken registry or
  machine source at reload keeps the last good copy. At startup, `serve` refuses to start
  on a broken file.
- **Test fixtures:** `block-sensitive-staging.sh` flags `TOKEN = ...` in tests even though the
  values come from `secrets.token_hex`. Append `# airuleset:secret-ok <reason>` to BOTH the
  `git add` and the `git commit`.
- **Rollout (dev1, owner account):**
  1. `python3 -m pip install --user --break-system-packages git+…@main`. This puts the script
     in `~/.local/bin/remoteos-gateway`, which is the unit's `ExecStart`.
  2. Copy `deploy/remoteos-gateway.service` to `~/.config/systemd/user/`.
  3. `systemctl --user enable --now remoteos-gateway`.
  4. `remoteos-gateway expose <machine>`.
  5. Verify from another tailnet node: 200 tools/list, 401 wrong token, 403 not allowed.
